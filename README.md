# NameBuilding
NameBuilding is a repository, or rather a helping hand for anyone having problems with coming with names for characters. I won't say that all of them are too accurate and updated, but it's better than nothing. If by chance you're having a problem to choose a name then use a random number generator between 1-MaximalLineValue. If I had time to turn it into a website I probably would. 

### So how does it work?
Simple. Traverse through the culture folders and pick whether it should be a male, female, or unisex name. After doing so you'll see a list of all the names I've gathered.
